intro: |
  I am a quantitative model developer with a strong focus on Finance. In my professional life there is a strong requirement for models
  that are simple and tractable. Therefore I have a clear tendency to choose models from ''classical econometrics'' domain for professional purposes. Personally
  I am fascinated by the advances that have been made by Deep Learning models. Following my interests I compiled a collection of Deep Learning models into this
  portfolio. The long term goal of this portfolio is to build a sense of how Deep Learning models may be transferred to applications in Financial research
  as well as practical questions in Finance.<br/><br/>
  Reinforcement Learning is one of my favourite applications of Deep Learning. A famous text book example ist the cart pole problem, where the learner observes the evironment consisting of a cart that balances as pole. The learner applies force ranging form -1 to 1 in order to prvent the pole from falling over for 200 consecuitve periods. The full implementation can be found in my projects below.<br/><br/>

#While most of the Deep Learning models are highly specific to a certain application, they also become increasingly popular in other fields.
#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML
